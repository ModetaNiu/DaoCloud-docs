# Authorization Policy

The authorization policy is similar to a four-layer to seven-layer "firewall". It will analyze and match the data flow 
like a traditional firewall, and then perform corresponding actions.
The authorization policy applies whether the request is from internal or external.

A reference YAML example for an authorization policy is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
   name: "ratings-viewer"
   namespace: default
spec:
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: ratings
   action: ALLOW
   rules:
   - from:
     - source:
         principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-reviews"]
     to:
     - operation:
         methods: ["GET"]
```

Service mesh provides two creation methods: wizard and YAML. The specific steps to create through the wizard are as follows:
